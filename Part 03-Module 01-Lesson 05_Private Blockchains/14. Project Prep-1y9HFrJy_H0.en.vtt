00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
We need to add functionality to validate the blocks and

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.250
process the data set when the Node.js application is restarting.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.779
In your next project,

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:11.864
you are tasked with a few challenges.

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:16.219
The first challenge is to process the data set utilizing level DB.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.594
Next, add functions to support block validation.

00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:25.349
We wanted to keep it fairly simple so we started you off with some boilerplate code.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.150
Don't get too excited.

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.029
Even with boilerplate code you will still need to

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.410
implement functions that support the project requirements.

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:38.414
The boilerplate code contains comments to assist you in the success of your project.

00:00:38.414 --> 00:00:42.519
Good luck and we will see you in the next course.
