00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.945
Welcome to the party.

00:00:01.945 --> 00:00:06.360
The third-party library, or I'll see myself out.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.695
So far in the course,

00:00:09.695 --> 00:00:11.699
we went through the planning stages of

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.199
integrating your private blockchain to a web service,

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:16.919
and then dove into the Node.js Framework.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.915
This here is a quick lesson,

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:22.554
where we'll take a look at some common libraries associated with these frameworks,

00:00:22.554 --> 00:00:25.684
which we'll be using in the upcoming project and discuss

00:00:25.684 --> 00:00:30.469
the ever growing importance of handling security on a blockchain web service.

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:36.859
These are the lesson topics: how to discover and use common third-party libraries,

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.920
using Bitcoin Core as an example to discover

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.189
third-party libraries to assist with RPC functions that we've seen before,

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:46.820
and lastly, discuss the risks and

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.700
precautions of working with third-party libraries and wallets,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.820
or anything that stores value.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.969
All right. With that, let's get cracking.
