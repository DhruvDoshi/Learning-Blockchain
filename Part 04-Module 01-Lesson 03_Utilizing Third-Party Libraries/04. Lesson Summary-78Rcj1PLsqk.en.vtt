00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.785
Now that was a short but really important discussion,

00:00:03.785 --> 00:00:06.084
and let's recap what we covered.

00:00:06.084 --> 00:00:10.500
We used Bitcoin Core as an example to discover third-party libraries,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.990
such as bitcoin-core and ethereumjs-util.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.855
We discussed the risks and precautions of working with third-party libraries and wallets.

00:00:19.855 --> 00:00:23.660
Lastly, we explored multi-signature wallets that use

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.190
an M-of-N transaction scheme. Now, what's next?

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.130
Moving forward, you'll pull together all the steps as you

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.570
configure an API web service with GET and POST endpoints,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.710
and migrate over your private blockchain.
