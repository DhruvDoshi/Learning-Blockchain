00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.365
Congratulations. You've made it to the end of the course.

00:00:03.365 --> 00:00:07.900
This course is a huge first step in your journey to becoming a blockchain developer.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.339
Throughout this course, we discussed fundamental concepts underlying

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:15.240
the blockchain and got started managing your identity on the blockchain.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.129
Our goal was to get you comfortable with

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:20.219
these new ideas and to prepare you to complete your first project,

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:23.074
where you'll begin managing your own blockchain identity.

00:00:23.074 --> 00:00:26.155
At this point, you're ready to go ahead and complete the project.

00:00:26.155 --> 00:00:31.670
We've provided a quick summary of everything we've covered so far down below the video.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.850
Take a minute to review this if you like,

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.445
and when you're ready, go ahead and get started on the project.

00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:40.079
We're excited to see your submission.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.399
And when you're done, we'll see you in the next course.
