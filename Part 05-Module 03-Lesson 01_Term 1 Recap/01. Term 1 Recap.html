  <p>Congratulations on completing the term! This has been an incredible journey, and we’re so proud of each and every one of you for making it this far! It’s been such an honor to teach you and see your projects, and we hope that you’ve learned a ton and found it as rewarding as we have!</p>

  <div>
  <p>Let’s take a look back at all we’re learned and accomplished together in this term, back from our humble beginnings as blockchain noobs just a few short months ago!</p>
<p>Starting the term you had some programming experience, or maybe were even a seasoned full stack dev, but you didn’t know much about the blockchain world. In the first course, we got introduced to this world at a high level to make sure we understood the concepts and had a solid foundation to build on. Things like hashing, consensus, and identity went from murky buzzwords to concrete concepts, you learned how blockchain networks differ from traditional networks and databases, and much more!</p>
<p>In your first project you created your very own blockchain identity using a bitcoin wallet. You couldn’t do much with it yet, but you’d already come a long way and built a solid conceptual foundation to dive deeper into Blockchain.</p>

  <h3></h3>
  <div>
  <p>The second course we did just that, diving deeper into the specifics of Bitcoin given its importance as the first and largest blockchain. We used it as an example to gain an in depth knowledge of how blockchain data works, and we learned about the difference between public and private blockchains. In your project you created your own private blockchain, and got some hands on experience adding and interacting with blocks on a blockchain!</p>
<p>Next up we explored web services, which opened up a whole new world of blockchain functionality to us! Hopefully in this course you really started imagining some of the awesome blockchain-powered applications you can build with libraries and web services.</p>
<p>We really got our hands dirty with two web services projects, first to build a web API for your private blockchain, and then to create your star notary web service! It was really starting to feel like the pieces were coming together, with our projects building on top of each other and now able to take input from a user on your web service and store it to your blockchain!</p>
<p>A solid blockchain education wouldn’t be complete without covering Ethereum of course, so that was our focus in the next course, where we learned about all the new possibilities and functionality that Ethereum opens up with smart contracts and decentralized apps. In your last project of the term, you built an Ethereum version of your star notary API to secure digital assets on Ethereum using smart contracts. You learned the basics of solidity, got hands on experience building smart contracts, and gained a solid understanding of the difference between building on Bitcoin vs. Ethereum!</p>

  <p>With all of these projects and concepts under your belt, the world of Blockchain is opening up to you! We hope you feel confident in your understanding of the concepts and platforms, proud of what you’ve built yourself in your projects, and that your imagination is running wild with ideas for revolutionary, decentralized, world-changing blockchain applications! </p>
<h1 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h1>
<p>In the second term, we’ll open up the blockchain world even further, exploring new use cases like supply chains, hybrid solutions, and data auditing. These are some of the bleeding edge frontiers of the blockchain industry, and the potential is huge for innovation that disrupts whole industries and even the global economy itself. You’ll continue building projects to gain hands on experience, including your Capstone project. </p>
<p>In this final project, you’ll get a chance to put into practice the possibilities you’re already dreaming of, and create a proof of concept for a new blockchain-powered product of your own! It will serve as a great portfolio piece and a way for you to put your own mark on the blockchain industry. We can’t wait to continue our journey together in the second term and see the amazing, innovative projects you’ll build!</p>
