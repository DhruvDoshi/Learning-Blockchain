00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.444
So, when people talk about blockchains,

00:00:02.444 --> 00:00:07.800
probably the best single sentence in order to encapsulate what they do is they are

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.714
tamper-resistant databases for storing things of

00:00:10.714 --> 00:00:13.994
value especially in an adversarial environment.

00:00:13.994 --> 00:00:17.160
You don't want somebody to randomly be able to write themselves a million dollars.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.469
You want to make it difficult and expensive for them to do that,

00:00:20.469 --> 00:00:23.369
maybe so expensive that it would be easier for them to make

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.155
a million dollars honestly than to write themselves a million dollars in this database,

00:00:27.155 --> 00:00:30.304
and that's the fundamental problem the blockchain solve.

00:00:30.304 --> 00:00:31.429
So, among other things,

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.274
since you don't want just anybody to be able to write themselves that data,

00:00:34.274 --> 00:00:36.409
you want it to be decentralized,

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:38.389
you want the power to be spread out a bit rather

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.789
than one actor being able to write themselves a million bucks.

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.189
Once you start thinking about the requirements for database to

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:45.554
represent money or money-like thing,

00:00:45.554 --> 00:00:48.439
you start to get to the phenomena that we observe in blockchain.

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:52.589
So, decentralized, immutable, and subject to global consensus.
