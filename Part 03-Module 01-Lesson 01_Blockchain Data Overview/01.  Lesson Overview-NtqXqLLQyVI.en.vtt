Welcome to the lesson.

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.514
We've covered a lot so far and we're ready to go over

00:00:04.514 --> 00:00:07.369
more details about the blockchain as a dataset.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.673
In this lesson, we'll talk about the blockchain dataset,

00:00:10.673 --> 00:00:14.519
it's use cases, and how it compares to other types of datasets.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.239
You'll explore a blockchain data and get a few more tips on how to work with in.

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:21.239
A lot of the data ideas we talked about earlier,

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:22.844
are really going to help here.

00:00:22.844 --> 00:00:26.729
These new concepts put you on the path towards completing project too.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.429
Where you'll create your own private blockchain.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.689
To get you started, we've put a summary of what

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.195
we'll cover throughout the lesson down below the video.

00:00:34.195 --> 00:00:37.240
Take a minute to look through this and get a better idea of topics we

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.375
will cover and how you'll start to apply them through the lesson.

00:00:40.375 --> 00:00:44.560
Once you're ready, move on to the next concept. We'll see you there.
