All right. So we just went over a few things like hard forks,

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.210
and soft forks, and I know a question I had when I first got started was,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.270
is there a way for me to get involved like what community is

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.670
really making these changes and where do I even go to do that to get started?

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.925
So I was wondering, do you have any idea about how someone might be able to get involved

00:00:15.925 --> 00:00:19.300
with the community that could help make these types of changes we're talking about.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.760
That's a great question.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.815
You know, with all great things open source,

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:28.180
there's a community that's driving those projects and the go-to right now is GitHub.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.340
And like, I think we all understand the power of GitHub, right?

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.405
You have a GitHub account,

00:00:32.405 --> 00:00:33.555
I have a GitHub account,

00:00:33.555 --> 00:00:35.790
I'm assuming you have a GitHub account as well.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.230
So what you can do is start participating in the community,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.090
it's very active and rich.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.920
We've seen a lot of politics come across in the blockchain space,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.855
like with the recent hard forks that came from Bitcoin,

00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:51.770
Bitcoin versus Bitcoin Cash.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.440
It's really interesting the political debate that goes

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.350
on and the biggest difference was block sizes, right?

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.130
Like that was a big driver between the original Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash,

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.770
but it's interesting because those politics allow all of us to participate.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.595
We get to go ahead and select which ones that we have

00:01:08.595 --> 00:01:13.290
most alignment with and we can go ahead and embed ourself within those communities.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.630
I would definitely advocate to start being active in the community within GitHub,

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.815
and if you have an improvement that you would like to propose,

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:25.165
go ahead and submit a pull request with the improvement and who knows,

00:01:25.165 --> 00:01:27.840
it might get adopted within the platform.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.680
Great. Thanks Brandy.
