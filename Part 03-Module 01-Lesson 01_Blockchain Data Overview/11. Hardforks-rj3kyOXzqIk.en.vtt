00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
One type of update that can happen to

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.745
a Blockchain results in what's known as a Hard Fork.

00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:08.995
In this video, we'll go over what a Hard Fork is,

00:00:08.994 --> 00:00:11.219
what effects it can have on a network,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.285
and look at an example using Bitcoin cash.

00:00:14.285 --> 00:00:18.394
A Hard Fork is a large change on the blockchain protocol.

00:00:18.394 --> 00:00:21.480
It's a permanent change to the software that conflicts with

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.780
the existing version resulting in an entirely new software.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.039
Once a Hard Fork is implemented,

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.195
it creates an entirely separate network.

00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:32.200
Users will need to choose if they want to

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.115
stick with the current network or choose the new one.

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:38.315
This happens because of how the change occurs.

00:00:38.314 --> 00:00:40.960
In a Hard Fork, software developers create

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.195
an exact copy of the entire Blockchain protocol.

00:00:44.195 --> 00:00:49.375
They can do this because the codebase for most block chains are completely open source.

00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:51.668
Once the developers make this copy,

00:00:51.668 --> 00:00:54.174
they write their new code into the software.

00:00:54.174 --> 00:00:57.954
Next, they need to decide when this change will take place.

00:00:57.954 --> 00:01:01.289
The way they do this is by specifying a block number.

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.074
For example, you could say,

00:01:03.075 --> 00:01:07.000
"Once we reach block 100 our changes will be implemented."

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.180
At this point, some nodes continue with

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.080
the original version and others transition to the alternative version.

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:15.719
They show their support of the version they chose

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:18.405
by adding blocks only to this new chain.

00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:21.689
Since each block chain is now building a different history,

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.370
they're no longer compatible.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.980
Even though they're now operating separately,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.049
they still have a shared history from before the fork.

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.454
That means that all transactions that happened before the fork are valid on both chains.

00:01:34.454 --> 00:01:37.319
This results in something pretty interesting.

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.304
Since you have a history of valid transactions,

00:01:40.305 --> 00:01:42.820
they need to be represented on both chains.

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:44.359
To make this happen,

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:46.549
the coins you had on the original version are

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.134
duplicated and given to you on the new version.

00:01:49.135 --> 00:01:53.810
So, if you had 100 coins on the original version before a Hard Fork,

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.070
you'll also have a 100 coins and whatever currency was created by the fork.

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.409
These coins are entirely separate from

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.125
the original coin and their values don't affect each other at all.

00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:06.620
Some people call this free money,

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.289
but that's only the case if the new currency

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.484
ever gets accepted enough to gain any real value.

00:02:12.485 --> 00:02:16.280
Hard Forks have happened on many different block chains already.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.754
As an example, you may have heard of Bitcoin cash.

00:02:19.754 --> 00:02:22.689
This currency was originally created because of

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:26.185
a disagreement on the block size of a Bitcoin block.

00:02:26.185 --> 00:02:28.479
Some developers wanted to double

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:32.484
the current block size and others wanted to make it even larger.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:34.599
When they couldn't come to an agreement,

00:02:34.598 --> 00:02:39.509
some developers went with an increased size and other stayed with the current block size.

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:43.069
That's why we now have bitcoin and Bitcoin cash.

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.000
To recap, a Hard Fork is a major change to the protocol of a Blockchain.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.889
It creates an entirely alternative software that is incompatible with the original.

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:57.519
This is different than a few other types of forks that we'll discuss next.
