00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.955
Blockchains, like a traditional database,

00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:04.790
are a way to store data.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.995
You can think of them as a dataset with specific characteristics.

00:00:08.994 --> 00:00:11.954
In this video, we will compare the characteristics

00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:15.220
of a Blockchain to those of a traditional database.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.030
To start, let's look at the network.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.950
Unlike traditional databases that rely on a centralized authority,

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.320
blockchains are supported by a distributed network.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.074
Blockchains allow anyone to download a copy of the database for themselves.

00:00:30.074 --> 00:00:34.954
This gives them full access to the data and functions available to the database.

00:00:34.954 --> 00:00:37.829
A benefit of this is that no single entity

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.500
can regulate the data that exists on the database.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.929
A downside to this is that there's

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:47.140
no central authority to help dictate what information is accurate.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.774
The distributed network was made as a way to reach consensus

00:00:50.774 --> 00:00:54.609
on the accuracy of data without the need for this authority.

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:58.619
As we've seen, the consensus algorithms involved with this can be pretty

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:02.500
complicated and results in other issues like network speeds.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.459
Next, there's different functions available to users

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.779
on a Blockchain when compared to a traditional database.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.814
While in a traditional database,

00:01:10.814 --> 00:01:12.629
users can create, read,

00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:15.379
update or delete data, in a Blockchain,

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:16.435
they can only read,

00:01:16.435 --> 00:01:18.100
append or validate data.

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:23.969
A major difference to note here is that Blockchains do not allow users to delete data.

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:26.819
Rather than deleting or overriding all data,

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:28.844
Blockchains create a new record.

00:01:28.844 --> 00:01:31.814
For example, in a Bitcoin transaction,

00:01:31.814 --> 00:01:34.844
let's say Brandy has 10 Bitcoin in her wallet.

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:39.700
The transactions that lead to this balance are permanently stored on the Blockchain.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.650
If Brandy gives me four Bitcoin,

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.750
that transaction is also recorded on the blockchain.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.569
Brandy's new wallet balance will appear as six Bitcoin.

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:55.064
The transactions that lead to her original balance of 10 Bitcoin are still not wiped out.

00:01:55.064 --> 00:01:59.640
They're recorded on the Blockchain along with any future transaction information.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.250
Since you can't delete Blockchain data,

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.745
the database is considered immutable.

00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:08.099
Immutable is the term used to describe any data that

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.694
cannot be updated after being added to the database.

00:02:11.694 --> 00:02:14.685
The benefit of this is that the Blockchain maintains

00:02:14.685 --> 00:02:19.009
a permanent historical record of all transactions that have happened on the network.

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:22.359
If there's any dispute over a Blockchain transaction,

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.790
there's always evidence to go back and check.

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:27.219
The downside to this is the immense amount of

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:31.044
memory space and resources that are needed to store this dataset.

00:02:31.044 --> 00:02:33.759
Next, the way authorization is handled on

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:37.280
a Blockchain is much different than in a traditional database.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.340
With a Blockchain, authorization isn't controlled by any central authority.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.129
Every user on the network has equal access to

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.025
data and functions available to each of the users.

00:02:48.025 --> 00:02:51.129
While both types of data are very secure,

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.884
the access you can gain from a single point of authorization is drastically different.

00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:58.239
Once you have the appropriate credentials,

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.045
you can gain access to any type of database.

00:03:01.044 --> 00:03:04.059
The differences on a Blockchain the best you

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.129
can do is get the credentials of a single user,

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.514
and even then you can only access their personal data.

00:03:10.514 --> 00:03:12.338
With a traditional database,

00:03:12.338 --> 00:03:14.530
if you get authorization for the database,

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.414
you just got access to the personal data of everyone in the system.

00:03:18.414 --> 00:03:22.884
For that reason, we consider data on a Blockchain to be more secure.

00:03:22.884 --> 00:03:26.474
But this type of security does come with some downsides.

00:03:26.474 --> 00:03:30.030
For one, without having a central authority and control,

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.265
it's difficult to resolve disputes that might come up.

00:03:33.264 --> 00:03:37.889
With a Blockchain, you can't call a company to fix something you disagree with.

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.184
The security is entirely handled by software running the system.

00:03:42.185 --> 00:03:45.670
The systems that help maintain Blockchain security exists to

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.264
facilitate the fact that a Blockchain is highly transparent.

00:03:49.264 --> 00:03:51.239
As we mentioned previously,

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.260
anyone can access the same data and

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:56.574
functionality provided to anyone else on a Blockchain.

00:03:56.574 --> 00:03:59.679
This is in contrast to a traditional database where

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.140
this permissioning is controlled by the authority that owns it.

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.309
We consider this open access to be an upside to

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.145
the Blockchain solutions because that's exactly why it was created in the first place.

00:04:11.145 --> 00:04:14.650
One potential downside to this is that you won't have

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.165
a careful permissioning system like on a traditional database.

00:04:18.165 --> 00:04:22.700
To recap, we just compare the differences between the network, functions,

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:27.675
mutability, security, and transparency of each of these database solutions.

00:04:27.675 --> 00:04:30.340
We tried to avoid making judgments about which

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:32.994
is better because that's not really the point,

00:04:32.995 --> 00:04:35.850
neither of these solutions is better than the other.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.950
Overall, they're only better or worse in a given situation.

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:44.039
There's also many other ways these databases could be compared.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.115
Things like the ease of use,

00:04:46.115 --> 00:04:48.300
integration with existing technologies,

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.079
and other important characteristics can definitely come into play here.

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:55.319
These are just some of the basics to get you started so feel

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:59.055
free to dig deeper into these ideas if you're interested in learning more.

00:04:59.055 --> 00:05:02.100
Hopefully, this is a good starting point for you.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.860
Understanding these differences will help you decide when

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.040
an application is best suited for the Blockchain and when it isn't.
