00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.009
We previously discussed hardforks and softforks.

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.679
It's important to note that there's also something called a source code fork,

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:10.179
which is neither of these.

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:12.779
A source code fork is the term used for copying

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:17.070
the entire codebase of an existing project to a new project.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.260
We mentioned that a source code fork happens in both a hardfork

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.780
and a softfork because there needs to be a copy of the code base made.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.359
But, it's possible to create that copy then never

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.365
tie back the updated software to the history of the software's blockchain.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.529
To be a softfork or hardfork,

00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:36.430
there needs to be that connection to

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:39.969
the original blockchain that the new software was forked from.

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:45.549
In a hardfork, the network maintains a shared history of transactions and in a softfork,

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:49.199
they maintain both their history and future transactions.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.960
An example of a source code fork is light coin.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.725
Light coin is a source code fork of Bitcoin that resulted in an alternative currency.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:02.170
With light coin, they copied the Bitcoin code base,

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.329
implemented their changes, and created

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:07.929
an entirely new block chain with no association to Bitcoin.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.475
The currency now trades as a completely separate alternative to Bitcoin.

00:01:12.474 --> 00:01:17.903
To recap, changes are implemented in Bitcoin using the Bitcoin improvement proposals.

00:01:17.903 --> 00:01:22.614
These changes are voted on by minors and implemented by software developers.

00:01:22.614 --> 00:01:26.284
These changes result in either a hardfork or softfork.

00:01:26.284 --> 00:01:29.054
In a hard fork the new version is permanent

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:31.945
and completely incompatible with the previous version.

00:01:31.944 --> 00:01:36.744
In softfork, the network only temporarily splits as the change rolls out.

00:01:36.745 --> 00:01:39.820
Both of these are different than a source code fork,

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:42.609
which is just a copy of the existing code base with

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:45.989
changes that break any relationship to the existing chain.

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:47.509
In the following quiz,

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.024
try to see if you can identify the different examples as either softforks,

00:01:51.024 --> 00:01:53.840
hardforks or source code forks.
