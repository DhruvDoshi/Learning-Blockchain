00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.549
As we've seen, the blockchain works using a peer-to-peer network.

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.655
It's useful to understand how this compares to other possibilities.

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:11.544
Is it better, worse, or just different?

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:14.429
Well, it's actually more about picking the right tool for

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.774
the application than trying to decide if one is always better than the other.

00:00:18.774 --> 00:00:21.929
Here we'll start by defining another type of network,

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:23.464
the client server model.

00:00:23.464 --> 00:00:26.089
From there, we'll be prepared to compare them to

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.500
decide when each might be a better fit for your application.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.690
Let's walk through the details.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.420
A client-server model is an application structure that breaks up

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.600
tasks between service providers and service requesters.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.289
A server is a centralized resource that

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:45.414
contains the information that users want to access.

00:00:45.414 --> 00:00:48.200
The client makes a request to the server and

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.630
the server responds with the information the client needs.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.990
There are different types of servers depending on the situation.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.795
Web servers serve websites and file servers serve computer files.

00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:03.780
You can even take the client server analogy beyond computers.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.299
Anything that provides any service like food or

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.155
beverages is a server and anyone they serve is the client.

00:01:10.155 --> 00:01:14.530
A client server infrastructure can contain many separate servers,

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.445
but these servers are owned by a single authority.

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:20.439
For example, Google, Amazon, Twitter,

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.359
and many other sites keep their data stored across servers that they own.

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:28.344
Having many servers helps ensure that if something happens to one,

00:01:28.344 --> 00:01:30.304
then information isn't lost.

00:01:30.305 --> 00:01:34.040
Clients or users like us will go to a website.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.080
Any action we take like asking a question or

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.185
searching for a product is a new request to the server.

00:01:40.185 --> 00:01:43.469
Once the server finds the information you're requesting,

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.670
it will serve it to you and load it onto your web browser.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.555
A single server can serve requests for many clients.

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:55.070
They do this using a communication protocol that is built into the network.

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:00.524
This request and response drives the entire relationship between clients and servers.

00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:03.330
This client server relationship is similar to

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.700
the P2P network but the way it's executed is different.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.479
A peer-to-peer network is a network of

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.715
computers that share access to files with each other.

00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:18.175
In peer-to-peer networks, every node is both the server and the client.

00:02:18.175 --> 00:02:20.500
They both hold information that others can

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.485
access and can request information from others.

00:02:23.485 --> 00:02:27.760
The peer-to-peer model allows us to have distributed or decentralized

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:32.134
networks rather than centralized networks like in a client-server model.

00:02:32.134 --> 00:02:35.409
There's one important thing to know as a potential problem of

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.704
peer-to-peer networks in the case of Bitcoin and other proof-of-work blockchains.

00:02:39.705 --> 00:02:42.140
If you have access to more computing power,

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:46.494
you can allocate more resources to mining and get more rewards for your effort.

00:02:46.495 --> 00:02:51.150
This gives you more money to buy more computers and get even more rewards.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.555
This cycle has caused problems for peer-to-peer networks using proof-of-work.

00:02:55.555 --> 00:02:58.400
The larger miners keep buying more resources,

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.270
getting larger and larger and this

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.760
centralizes all the work happening to just a few nodes.

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:07.439
Centralizing the power and information defeats the purpose of

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.139
a distributed network and is a major reason why

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.589
the blockchain is turning to solutions outside of proof-of-work.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.280
Coming up, we'll look at some more differences between these two models.
