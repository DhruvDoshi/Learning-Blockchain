00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
So, we just got done learning about different types of block chains,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.004
like public, private, and hybrid.

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:07.529
And we're about to jump into the data model

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.780
that kind of underlies any of those block chains.

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:13.009
And I was wondering if you could explain kind of why that's important to understand?

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.390
It's super important. When you sit there and think

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.810
about the different types of block chains that exist,

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:20.524
we have private, public,

00:00:20.524 --> 00:00:21.639
and of course hybrid.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.410
And it was fantastic, we just got done learning those differences.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.039
But, now it's time to explore block chain data model.

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.000
We want to understand what that data really is and how we can work with it.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.810
That's going to dictate the type of usage in regards to a block chain type.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.620
Sometimes, data should be exposed on

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:41.619
the private chain that's not accessible to the public.

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:45.044
That's a great use case for having a private block chain.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:48.535
There's of course, so many more ways to go ahead and experiment with this,

00:00:48.534 --> 00:00:51.149
but the very first thing that we know, we need to explore.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.254
So, let's go ahead and start exploring block chain data.

00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:55.160
Great thanks Brandy
