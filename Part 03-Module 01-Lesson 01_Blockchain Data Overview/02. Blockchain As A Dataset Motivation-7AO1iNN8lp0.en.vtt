00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
Hey, I'm sitting here with Brandy and we're about to get started on this next lesson.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.770
So, I want to ask you a couple of questions real quick, before we get started.

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:09.750
Throughout this lesson, we're going to be talking about

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.820
the blockchain as a dataset and comparing it to

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.980
traditional databases and I was wondering if you could

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.725
explain why that's an important thing to even understand?

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:18.500
Yeah, that's an excellent question.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.929
So, right now, we have traditional datasets that we're all comfortable with.

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.314
With blockchain, it's a new way to look at a dataset. It's immutable.

00:00:26.315 --> 00:00:28.500
So, we're going to look at the fundamental difference

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.240
between traditional datasets and blockchain datasets.

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:32.989
So, we can actually start working with it.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.690
Yeah, there's definitely certain limitations that the blockchain has,

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:37.939
but there's some incredible things that it can do.

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:41.869
So, it's great to hear how we can compare it to traditional database.

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:45.375
Another thing I was wondering is in this lesson, we're taking a step back,

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:47.570
still I'm talking about conceptual things rather than

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.030
really diving in and starting to program and I was

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.429
wondering if you had any insights on why it's important that

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:54.990
we really understand this before we move ahead?

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.929
Without a doubt, there's some differences

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:59.030
and we need to understand those fundamental differences.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.320
So in this lesson,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.990
we're really hoping to set the fundamental values of

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.930
blockchain as a different means of a dataset that we're going to work with.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.645
After all, the goal here is for

00:01:08.644 --> 00:01:14.125
a decentralized ledger that is replicatable amongst nodes, right?

00:01:14.125 --> 00:01:18.834
Peer to peer network. So, a lot of different ways of working with this dataset,

00:01:18.834 --> 00:01:21.779
this can just take just a little bit of time to understand those fundamentals.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.629
All right, thanks Brandy.

00:01:23.629 --> 00:01:26.319
So, keep that in mind as we go through the rest of the lesson.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:29.619
Next, we're going to start off by comparing a blockchain to a traditional dataset.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.400
So I'll see you there.
