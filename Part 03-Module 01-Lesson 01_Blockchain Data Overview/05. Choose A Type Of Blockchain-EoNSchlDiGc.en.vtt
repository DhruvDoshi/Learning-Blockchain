00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.014
Knowing the basics of how each type of blockchain works,

00:00:04.014 --> 00:00:07.754
we can now decide which of these is the right one for our application.

00:00:07.754 --> 00:00:10.949
We can do this by asking ourselves questions.

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:14.089
First, will all transactions be public?

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.725
In this case, everyone will have full access to the data in the network.

00:00:18.725 --> 00:00:20.780
If that works for your application,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.355
you can choose a public blockchain.

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:27.120
In most situations where a public blockchain won't work,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.160
it's because there are some regulations or

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.034
permissions that a company will need control over.

00:00:32.034 --> 00:00:34.219
When working with company data,

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.649
that's particularly a good time to think of the next question.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.899
Will all transactions be restricted to only specific users?

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:43.589
If the answer is yes,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.980
then a private blockchain is probably the best option here.

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:49.619
Another note though, is that it's also

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:52.524
a good time to consider if you need a blockchain at all.

00:00:52.524 --> 00:00:58.144
Like we mentioned, a lot of the value of a blockchain is thought to be its open access.

00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:01.510
It's possible that a private blockchain is the right solution,

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:04.079
but be sure to consider the value a blockchain is

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:07.364
adding if this core benefit is being restricted.

00:01:07.364 --> 00:01:09.670
Finally, ask yourself this.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.760
Should some information be public,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.965
while other information is restricted?

00:01:13.965 --> 00:01:18.329
This could be the case if you want to share information across multiple companies,

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:21.170
but not have it be completely open to the public.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.049
If the answer is yes,

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.905
then a hybrid blockchain could be the right solution in this case.

00:01:26.905 --> 00:01:32.219
These questions are a great starting point as a check for any new ideas you might have.

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:33.954
To make the final decision,

00:01:33.954 --> 00:01:38.204
we'll take some extra thought as you consider the unique situation you're up against.

00:01:38.204 --> 00:01:41.459
Once you decide which type of blockchain you'd like to use,

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:44.619
there are still many things to consider about how to implement it.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.990
To understand how it could be implemented,

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:50.834
it helps to dig in and see what the underlying data structures could look like.

00:01:50.834 --> 00:01:55.369
We'll cover that next by exploring data in the Bitcoin blockchain.
