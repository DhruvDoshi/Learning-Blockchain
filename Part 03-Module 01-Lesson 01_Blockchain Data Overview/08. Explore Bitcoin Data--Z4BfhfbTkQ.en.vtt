00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
Previously, we covered some of the questions you can ask to

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.750
decide if a blockchain is the right solution for your application.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.105
Once deciding to use a blockchain,

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:13.620
it's important to know how the data is constructed so that you can use it effectively.

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:19.024
In this video, we'll explore some of this data and investigate the structure of a block.

00:00:19.024 --> 00:00:23.059
Blocks contain two main sections that each hold important data.

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:25.589
The first section is the block header.

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.039
The block header contains metadata about the block including

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.170
things like the hash value which allows to connect blocks into a chain.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.899
The second section is the body of the block.

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.640
The body contains all of the blocks transaction information.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.905
We can investigate this data using a few different tools.

00:00:42.905 --> 00:00:47.530
To start, we'll take a closer look at this data using an online block explorer.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.789
Later on, we'll be doing this type of stuff programmatically.

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.820
We're starting with this website so you can focus on the contents of

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.134
the block rather than worrying about getting set up with your programming environment.

00:00:58.134 --> 00:01:00.070
If you'd like to follow along,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.439
you can go to the website block

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:05.435
explorer.com or follow the link we've provided in the notes below.

00:01:05.435 --> 00:01:07.435
All right, let's get started.

00:01:07.435 --> 00:01:10.049
Let's begin by going to a specific block.

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.454
You can do that by typing a block number over here in the top left.

00:01:14.454 --> 00:01:18.980
For this example, I'll use block 520607.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.765
But feel free to use whichever block you like.

00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:23.390
After Choosing a block,

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.734
you'll see the block header.

00:01:24.734 --> 00:01:26.819
There's information here like the hash,

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:29.899
height, timestamp in previous block.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.645
If you click on the previous or next block,

00:01:32.644 --> 00:01:37.324
the site will load information for whatever details are included for that block.

00:01:37.325 --> 00:01:40.820
Now, let's take a look at the block transaction data.

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:45.429
You can scroll down to the bottom of the page to see each of the blocks transactions.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.015
This information makes up the bulk of the blocks data.

00:01:49.015 --> 00:01:52.420
They're listed in order as they were verified on the network.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.909
At the top is the first transaction and

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.789
way down at the bottom is the most recent transaction.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.940
This first transaction is known as the coinbase.

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.140
There's not really anything special about it,

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.875
it's just the term used for the first transaction.

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:08.650
Scrolling through to see some other transactions,

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.405
you'll notice that each of them contains certain details.

00:02:11.405 --> 00:02:17.189
On the left is the transaction inputs and over on the right is the transaction outputs.

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.490
Down at the bottom is the fee,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.790
the number of conformations,

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:22.125
and the amounts sent.

00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:24.435
Let's look at this transaction.

00:02:24.435 --> 00:02:26.430
After clicking on the hash value,

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.310
you'll see some of the summary data about the transaction

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.055
followed by the details of the transaction inputs and outputs.

00:02:33.055 --> 00:02:36.545
These are the same details that were provided on the main page.

00:02:36.544 --> 00:02:41.719
This is telling us that these two inputs were added together giving us these outputs.

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:44.400
The top one is how much we sent and the bottom

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.370
one is how much change was given back to the sender.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.189
You can also see that to make this transaction,

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.359
the miner collected this much as a fee.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.495
There are this many confirmations and

00:02:54.495 --> 00:02:57.390
this was the original amount of Bitcoin that was sent.

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:01.659
That's the basics of how to get started with this online block explorer.

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.400
Using this, you can continue to explore block data and transactions.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.520
This will help you get more familiar with how the ideas behind how

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.600
a block works actually translates into real-world data
