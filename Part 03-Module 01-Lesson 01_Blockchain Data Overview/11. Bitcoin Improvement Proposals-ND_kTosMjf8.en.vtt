00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The Bitcoin protocol is made up of a bunch of rules.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.910
Sometimes, a rule of the Bitcoin protocol needs to be changed.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.115
For example, how should miners be rewarded?

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:13.179
How large should a block be?

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.745
Decisions have been made on this already but that doesn't mean they can't be improved.

00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:22.135
These are the types of questions that can affect how the entire network operates.

00:00:22.135 --> 00:00:25.845
Bitcoin, like any software project, is always improving.

00:00:25.844 --> 00:00:29.929
So updates like these will continue to happen as the software evolves.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.429
In Bitcoin, this process of updating

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:35.939
the software starts with a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal.

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:38.059
Bitcoin Improvement Proposals are

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.350
technical documents used to issue changes to the Bitcoin Core Client.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.484
We discussed this earlier in the program when we went over BIP 39,

00:00:46.484 --> 00:00:49.219
which helped create deterministic wallets.

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.475
You can find this and other Bitcoin Improvement Proposals

00:00:52.475 --> 00:00:57.515
at github.com/bitcoin/bips which we've linked below the video.

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:59.450
These proposals are written by

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.495
community members who believe they can improve the protocol.

00:01:02.494 --> 00:01:05.715
They're sent out to the network and published publicly.

00:01:05.715 --> 00:01:09.865
At this point, the proposal is only a suggestion for an improvement.

00:01:09.864 --> 00:01:14.185
Before being implemented, the proposal needs to go through a voting process.

00:01:14.185 --> 00:01:17.719
This vote is taken by the miners in the Bitcoin network.

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:22.239
If the proposal gets a majority vote from the miners, it'll be implemented.

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:24.819
This means the miners actually have control over

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:27.489
the implementation of updates to the network.

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:29.769
Miners are a good choice for this because they're

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:32.859
clearly invested in the improvement of the protocol.

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.599
Once a vote is taken,

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:37.329
the proposal is either accepted or denied.

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.254
If accepted, it's time to start implementing the proposed changes into the software.

00:01:42.254 --> 00:01:44.969
This works and continues to drive improvements to

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:47.974
the Bitcoin protocol but there are some concerns.

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:50.939
For one, miners are important but they don't

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.114
always represent the best interests of the entire network.

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.869
This can be a problem.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.859
For example, miners can vote for proposals that favor

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:02.120
themselves and turn down proposals that may hurt them.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.365
If something could improve the network performance but lower miner fees,

00:02:06.364 --> 00:02:10.495
it may get denied because the miners are concerned about the money they can earn.

00:02:10.495 --> 00:02:14.069
It could be that this is the right move but it is a situation

00:02:14.068 --> 00:02:17.804
where miners have to choose between personal incentives and progress.

00:02:17.805 --> 00:02:19.795
The system works pretty well but,

00:02:19.794 --> 00:02:21.479
we want to point this out because it is

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:23.984
somewhat of a concern for the network at this point.

00:02:23.985 --> 00:02:27.180
Depending on how significant a change is to the network,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.920
it can be really difficult to get everyone to agree on the right direction.

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:35.534
It's possible for some users to adopt the change and for others to deny it.

00:02:35.534 --> 00:02:40.169
If this happens, the network splits into those who have adopted it and those who haven't.

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:42.989
These network splits are known as forks.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.040
Coming up, we'll discuss the different types of forks that can happen.
