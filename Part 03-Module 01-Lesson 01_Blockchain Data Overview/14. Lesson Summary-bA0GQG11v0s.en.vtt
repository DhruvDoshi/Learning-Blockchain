00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.585
All right. We've reached the end of this lesson.

00:00:02.585 --> 00:00:04.879
Congratulations. Throughout this lesson,

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.400
we covered a ton of new material on the blockchain as a dataset.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.540
We walked through some of the basic ideas,

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:12.399
like when to use a blockchain?

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.720
And how it compares to other possibilities?

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.839
From there, you explored blockchain data using the Blockchain Explorer.

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:23.754
Finally, we covered a few core ideas like peer-to-peer versus the client server model.

00:00:23.754 --> 00:00:28.474
How the mining process controls the chain and softforks versus hardforks.

00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:31.410
We'll continue building on these ideas in the next lesson,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.375
where we start working with the Bitcoin Core Client.

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:37.750
We put a quick overview of this lesson down below the video.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.804
Check this out for a few more details,

00:00:39.804 --> 00:00:42.729
and when you're ready, we'll see you in the next lesson.
