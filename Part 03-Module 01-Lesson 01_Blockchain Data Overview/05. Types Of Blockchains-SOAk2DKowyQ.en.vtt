00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.105
Once you decide that a blockchain seems like the right solution,

00:00:04.105 --> 00:00:07.830
you'll need to think through which type of blockchain you might want to use.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.470
There are three main types of blockchains.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.900
A public blockchain, a private blockchain and a Hybrid Blockchain.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.219
In this video, we'll define each of

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:19.515
these blockchain types and cover when

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:22.260
each might be the best solution for your application.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.290
First, a public blockchain is what we've been assuming through this program so far.

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.009
On a public blockchain,

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.530
everything is open for the entire network.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.109
Anyone can join and get access to add and verify transactions.

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:39.439
Bitcoin is an example of a public blockchain.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:43.789
A private blockchain is basically the opposite of a public blockchain.

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.379
You get the functionality of a blockchain,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.790
but still have the ability to restrict who can join the network.

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.054
Rather than anyone being able to join and verify on the network,

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.715
you can explicitly assign those permissions to specific users.

00:00:57.715 --> 00:01:01.650
This is similar to the difference between an internet and an intranet.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.579
The Internet is freely available and accessible to anyone,

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.655
but companies may use an intranet to share secure internal documents.

00:01:09.655 --> 00:01:14.015
This allows them to keep permission restricted to the users within their company.

00:01:14.015 --> 00:01:17.239
That's exactly what you can do with a private blockchain.

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:22.564
You can restrict users to the people in your company or to any group you have in mind.

00:01:22.564 --> 00:01:25.739
Private blockchains have an interesting reputation.

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:29.979
Some people say they're useless and defeat the whole purpose of the blockchain.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.064
If you want full control over information you don't plan on sharing,

00:01:34.064 --> 00:01:36.590
then why not use a traditional database.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.780
On the other hand, some major corporations seem to be

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.340
pushing the idea of privately hosted blockchain services.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.620
One useful possibility of a private blockchain is

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.859
to restrict access to features that are still being tested.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.620
You wouldn't always want full open access to

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.020
features that you're still working on and testing before deployment.

00:01:56.019 --> 00:02:00.640
A Hybrid Blockchain is a mix of both a public and private blockchain.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.280
In a hybrid Blockchain,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.950
transactions stay private while allowing a network

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.030
of users to create and validate transactions.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.435
Owners of the blockchain,

00:02:09.435 --> 00:02:12.120
can determine which transactions should only be visible

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.509
to certain smaller groups and which can remain public.

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:18.419
The goal here is to get the best of both worlds.

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:22.530
For example, you might be a company that wants to share product information with

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.330
other companies and allow a subset of that information to be available publicly.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.005
As a food distributor maybe you track the price and ownership

00:02:31.004 --> 00:02:34.919
of your products supply chain as they move from the farmer to the consumer.

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:37.399
You can track this on any blockchain,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.254
but on a Hybrid Blockchain you could set certain restrictions.

00:02:41.254 --> 00:02:45.299
You can share all the information with the companies that are involved but if you

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.460
want consumers could be restricted from

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.415
seeing the price at each stage in the supply chain.

00:02:50.414 --> 00:02:54.120
This would allow them to see that the food is really coming from where you say it

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.189
is but wouldn't show them some of them were

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.979
classified information that you'd prefer to hide.

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:02.750
While it's easier to think about use cases for a Hybrid Blockchain,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.344
it's similar to a private blockchain and that some people really don't like the idea.

00:03:07.344 --> 00:03:11.454
It's easy to see that this is a form of re-centralizing the information

00:03:11.454 --> 00:03:15.670
to be restricted on an as needed basis by the company in control of it.

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:17.574
What you do get from this though,

00:03:17.574 --> 00:03:19.969
is a middle ground where information can be shared on

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:23.990
the blockchain even if some of the information needs to be kept through yourself.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.439
So to recap, we just went over three types of blockchains.

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:29.780
Public, private and hybrid.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.879
Each of these networks operates using

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.514
the same encrypted data using wallets and keys like we've spoken about previously.

00:03:36.514 --> 00:03:41.334
Where they differ is in how much you have the ability to restrict access to this data.

00:03:41.335 --> 00:03:44.629
public blockchains allow open access to all the data

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.974
in the network and allow anyone to become a node in that network.

00:03:47.974 --> 00:03:51.280
Private blockchains do the complete opposite and restrict

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.810
this data to only specific users and finally,

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.120
Hybrid Blockchains are a mixture of these two types that allow you to

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.730
restrict some information while allowing other information to remain public
