Hey and welcome back.

00:00:01.465 --> 00:00:06.044
At this point you're hopefully up and running with your Hello World Hapi JS application.

00:00:06.044 --> 00:00:08.519
In this video, we'll open up the project we just

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.594
made to get a better idea of what's going on with the code.

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:14.835
To start, open up the project folder in your editor.

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:17.550
What you'll notice here is that there's much less going

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.195
on than there was with your Sales JS application.

00:00:20.195 --> 00:00:23.884
It actually looks much more similar to the Express application.

00:00:23.884 --> 00:00:25.800
Here's the node modules,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.580
the package.json and the server.js file we created.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.609
The server.js file is a little different than what we

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:35.714
saw in our Express application's index.js file,

00:00:35.715 --> 00:00:38.285
but it's doing all the same basic things.

00:00:38.284 --> 00:00:42.254
Let's walk through some of the code to get a better idea of what's going on here.

00:00:42.255 --> 00:00:45.705
First, we create a constant that requires Hapi.

00:00:45.704 --> 00:00:47.119
In the next few lines,

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:49.614
we create a server hosted on port 8,000,

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:54.280
which is why we're able to access this app at localhost 8,000 in the browser.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.304
Next, we add the roots in,

00:00:56.304 --> 00:00:57.774
in this case using GET,

00:00:57.774 --> 00:01:00.244
but can be GET or Post or whatever,

00:01:00.244 --> 00:01:03.364
depending on how you want to handle the URL endpoints.

00:01:03.365 --> 00:01:05.930
This is followed by the path for the URL.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.560
In this case, it's being placed at localhost:8000/hello.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.609
Down towards the bottom,

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:16.000
you have the functions that are used to start the server.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.379
Some error handling and a lock to the console that tells you the server is running.

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:23.149
So, that's really the basics of what's going on inside

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.040
the project folder of your Hapi JS application.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.729
We went through this a little quicker than the other applications

00:01:28.728 --> 00:01:31.879
because it's a lot of pretty similar stuff that you've seen already.

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:34.250
As always, you can check out the documentation and

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.890
resources supplied on the Hapi JS homepage.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.945
This is a great way to learn more about this framework's functionality,

00:01:39.944 --> 00:01:42.949
or to keep going through some of the tutorials they provide.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.010
Great job working through this section and congratulations on getting

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.070
started with your Hello World Hapi JS application.
