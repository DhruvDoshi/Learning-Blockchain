Hey and welcome back.

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.080
In this video, we'll walk through the steps needed to

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.040
create your hapi js Hello World application.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.905
To get started, go back to hapijs.com and click on Tutorials.

00:00:11.904 --> 00:00:16.230
The first tutorial is to help get you up and running with hapi js.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.050
To start, we'll need to create a directory for our project.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.335
To do this, open your terminal.

00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:24.095
I'll create mine on my desktop.

00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:26.219
So, first I'll cd to my desktop,

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:29.289
and then make a directory called hapi-app.

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:36.204
Next, cd into this folder and type npm init to initialize npm for the project.

00:00:36.204 --> 00:00:41.954
After initializing npm, type npm install hapi --save,

00:00:41.954 --> 00:00:46.619
to install hapi js and write dependencies to your package.json file.

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:50.119
After this, you'll create the server script in Sails js.

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:51.210
This was done for you,

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.789
but we did something similar to this,

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:54.954
when we were getting started with Express.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:56.429
To create this file,

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:59.854
I'll use touch server.js in my terminal.

00:00:59.854 --> 00:01:01.939
Now that we have all our files ready,

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:05.864
we'll need to paste the server script code into our server.js file.

00:01:05.864 --> 00:01:09.474
For this, I actually prefer to use the code shown on the homepage.

00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:12.199
It's slightly different than that on the tutorial page,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.760
but I find that it's quicker for me to get started this way.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.815
So, I'll go back to the homepage,

00:01:16.814 --> 00:01:19.439
paste in the code and save this file.

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.780
Perfect. Now, we have everything set up and we're ready to run our application.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.310
To run the file, open your terminal and type in npm start, then hit Enter.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.615
This creates an application you can view in your browser by going to your local host.

00:01:33.614 --> 00:01:35.464
So, let's go to the browser.

00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:39.924
Go to local host:colon8000/hello and there we go.

00:01:39.924 --> 00:01:43.480
We're up and running with our hello world application using hapi js.
