00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
Welcome to this video, on getting started with hapi js.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.390
In this video, we'll quickly go over the goals of this framework as

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:09.934
well as the tools and resources available to you as a developer.

00:00:09.935 --> 00:00:14.140
To get to the hapi js website, go to hapijs.com.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.380
As we've seen they pitch themselves as

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.554
a rich framework for building applications and services.

00:00:19.554 --> 00:00:23.009
They're selling point is that it allows developers to focus on writing

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.985
reusable application logic instead of spending time building infrastructure.

00:00:26.984 --> 00:00:29.730
This makes it super quick and simple to get started building

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.270
applications and it's a great fit for the project we'll be working on in this course.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.540
Right on the front page they show you how to install

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:39.064
this framework using npm install hapi,

00:00:39.064 --> 00:00:40.989
which we'll be doing in just a minute.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.520
Scrolling down a bit they go right in and show you

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.025
how to start building an application for yourself.

00:00:46.024 --> 00:00:51.320
You will initialize with your package.json saving hapi.js as a dependency,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.353
and below that is the script we'll use to start up and run your application.

00:00:55.353 --> 00:00:57.064
Back up at the top of the page,

00:00:57.064 --> 00:00:58.519
you'll get access to documents,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.109
resources, tutorials and a community of developers that can help you out along the way.

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.144
Looking over at the resources,

00:01:05.144 --> 00:01:07.759
you can see the books that they recommend to get started.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.940
Books are great, but sometimes it take a lot of commitment to get through,

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.194
especially if your main focus isn't on mastering hapi js.

00:01:14.194 --> 00:01:16.219
In that case, you can go down a little further

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:18.439
and see different resources like code samples,

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.474
boilerplates, projects, tutorials, and videos.

00:01:21.474 --> 00:01:26.669
These are excellent ways to get more ideas for what you can accomplish using hapi js.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.780
Finally, head over to tutorials to help get started

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.769
with installing and creating your Hello World application.

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:34.519
We'll be working through this next,

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:36.409
but since we've been through a few of these now,

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.524
you might feel comfortable trying it for yourself.

00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:39.975
If so that's great,

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:41.594
but if you'd rather walk along with me,

00:01:41.594 --> 00:01:45.370
then we'll be going through it in the next video and I'll see you there.
