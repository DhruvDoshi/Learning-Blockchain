00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.835
Welcome back. In this video,

00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:04.429
we're going to walk through creating the Sails "Hello, World!"

00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:08.094
application. We'll just be following along through their documentation.

00:00:08.095 --> 00:00:10.769
So, if you'd rather speak through and do it yourself,

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.484
you'll be right along with us by the end of this video.

00:00:13.484 --> 00:00:15.219
If you stick with us, hopefully,

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.370
there's some helpful tips and tricks along the way

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.269
that will help you get even more familiar with the process.

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.544
To start, head back to sailsjs.com.

00:00:23.545 --> 00:00:26.250
Once you're there, click on Get started.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.405
Scrolling down, you'll see the directions on how to start building your application.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:34.125
At this point, you've hopefully been working with Node.js for awhile already.

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:36.159
So, you can skip this first section.

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:40.394
Now, jump over to your terminal to install Sails using the command they show,

00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:44.850
npm install sails -g. After a few seconds,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.760
you'll have Sails installed on your computer.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.800
Next, we need to create a place to hold the test project.

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:54.984
To do that, I'll go to my desktop,

00:00:54.984 --> 00:00:57.134
create a Sails project folder,

00:00:57.134 --> 00:00:59.089
then cd into that folder.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.365
Now, type sails new test-project.

00:01:02.365 --> 00:01:05.900
A prompt will appear that is giving you the option to either start

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.725
your app with existing functionality or to start from scratch.

00:01:09.724 --> 00:01:14.164
For this demo, we'll start with the template web app by selecting one.

00:01:14.165 --> 00:01:17.495
At this point, all the dependencies will start to install,

00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:19.160
which can take a minute or so.

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.789
You can open the folder to see all the files that are being installed.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.905
When it's done, it'll let you know that the Sails app test project was created.

00:01:27.905 --> 00:01:33.060
Finally, navigate into your test project folder using cd test-project.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.350
Then type sails lift into the terminal.

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:39.864
See, it's not only the squid pictures in documentation,

00:01:39.864 --> 00:01:43.099
even the code itself is playing off the sailboat analogy.

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:45.129
At this point, you've lifted the Sails,

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:47.655
and you're ready to check out your Sails application.

00:01:47.655 --> 00:01:54.379
Open a new browser window and type localhost:1337 to see how it looks.

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:57.369
It's pretty nice how much they set up for us to start.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.965
The page itself directs you through what they've done,

00:01:59.965 --> 00:02:02.870
how it works, and where to find even more resources.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.370
Feel free to look around for a little while to explore your new application.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.625
When you're ready, come back to us the next video,

00:02:08.625 --> 00:02:11.669
where we'll go through the project files to look through what just happened.
