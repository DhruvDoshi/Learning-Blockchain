Hey, and welcome to this introduction to Sails js.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.344
In this video, we'll start taking a deeper look at the Sails js framework.

00:00:07.344 --> 00:00:10.484
To start, we'll go to sailsjs.com.

00:00:10.484 --> 00:00:12.239
The first thing you'll notice here is

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.394
the cool-looking squid that links to some basic information.

00:00:15.394 --> 00:00:19.214
This squid is the start of a trend you'll see a lot with this framework.

00:00:19.214 --> 00:00:22.975
It seems like they've done everything they can to make connections between the framework,

00:00:22.975 --> 00:00:25.605
and sailboats, and ocean creatures.

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:27.359
You can scroll down a little to see

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.344
the main things they point out that Sails can help you with.

00:00:30.344 --> 00:00:33.259
The framework is written completely in JavaScript,

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:34.969
can connect to any database,

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.679
and provides blueprints to help create Rest APIs instead of building them from scratch.

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:43.195
Also, it's compatible with any front-end like Angular,

00:00:43.195 --> 00:00:45.909
React, iOS and anything else.

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:51.265
It's got easy WebSocket integration and also provides professional support for its users.

00:00:51.265 --> 00:00:53.895
What this all means is that it's simple to use,

00:00:53.895 --> 00:00:55.725
well integrated with other tools,

00:00:55.725 --> 00:00:58.835
and has excellent documentation to help you get started.

00:00:58.835 --> 00:01:01.384
You can see all that up here in the menu bar.

00:01:01.384 --> 00:01:03.890
Under get started, they help you set sail

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.534
with the basics of starting your first application.

00:01:06.534 --> 00:01:08.765
From installation, to app creation,

00:01:08.765 --> 00:01:10.099
to some new cool ideas,

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:12.674
it's all here to help support you along the way.

00:01:12.674 --> 00:01:16.344
Under support, you'll see community resources like FAQs,

00:01:16.344 --> 00:01:18.385
live chat, Stack Overflow,

00:01:18.385 --> 00:01:19.700
and classes you can take.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.025
There's also professional resources like partnerships,

00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:26.555
support, presentations, and Sails job opportunity.

00:01:26.555 --> 00:01:28.465
Finally, under the documentation,

00:01:28.465 --> 00:01:30.310
you'll find stuff like reference material,

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.174
descriptions of important concepts,

00:01:32.174 --> 00:01:35.239
tutorials, and even more useful resources.

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:38.949
They've made this site really intuitive for you to explore yourself.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.915
So, feel free to read through and work through some of the material they provide.

00:01:42.915 --> 00:01:45.980
Coming up, we'll work through their Hello World application

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.725
together to help make sure you're comfortable with the basics.

00:01:48.724 --> 00:01:52.214
So, if you'd, like explore documentation for a bit and when you're ready,

00:01:52.215 --> 00:01:53.730
we'll see you in the next video.
