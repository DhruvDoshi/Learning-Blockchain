Hey and welcome back.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.839
Now, that we have a sales JS application,

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:07.169
it helps to look at the files and folders that are making it all work.

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:08.675
As you probably noticed,

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:13.470
sales JS has provided a lot more functionality out-of-the-box then expressed it.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.000
The upside of this is that you can get started quickly with your application.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.039
A possible downside is that it could be more difficult to get

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.679
familiar with everything that's going on to make the application work.

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.925
In this video, we'll walk through the main features of our new application.

00:00:27.925 --> 00:00:31.505
To start, open your environment using your code editor.

00:00:31.504 --> 00:00:34.789
What I see here first is the.gitignore file.

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:37.004
This file explains itself pretty well.

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:38.390
If you haven't seen one before,

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.130
take a minute to read through it.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.320
Basically, it gives you a way to exclude files

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.365
from your apps repository if you're using Git.

00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:48.650
Since so much has been installed for you to get started,

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.884
sales JS made an excellent ReadMe file

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.594
to help you understand all the features they provide.

00:00:53.594 --> 00:00:59.164
The package.json file is where all the dependencies for the project had been saved.

00:00:59.164 --> 00:01:01.820
Similar to, in your express application,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.280
this holds various metadata about the project and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.629
helps npm manage the projects dependencies.

00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:09.609
In the node modules folder,

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:11.795
you'll see all the modules that were installed.

00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:16.094
You can find the details about what these modules do using the documentation.

00:01:16.094 --> 00:01:19.250
You can also open up the files and look through the code yourself,

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.224
if you're interested to see how any of the functions are working.

00:01:22.224 --> 00:01:24.164
To create this application,

00:01:24.165 --> 00:01:27.045
we originally run sales lift in our terminal.

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:29.420
To see how to run this without sales list,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.760
you can go to the app.js file.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.939
Its goals, purpose and documentation are described right here in the file.

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.789
Basically, this is saying that you can start the application using node app.js,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.190
just like how in Express,

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.620
we run node index.js.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.195
If you're interested in seeing the files that create

00:01:47.194 --> 00:01:49.634
each of the pages generated by the application,

00:01:49.635 --> 00:01:51.550
you can find them under views.

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.954
For each of these, you can go back to the application and see things like the emails,

00:01:55.954 --> 00:01:58.859
layouts, account, dashboard, and more.

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:02.060
This is all functionality that was provided automatically when you

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.655
selected one while creating the application from the terminal.

00:02:05.655 --> 00:02:09.319
If you don't want this in your app and would prefer to start from scratch,

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.215
you can always create a new application without this default functionality.

00:02:13.215 --> 00:02:15.884
To do that, just install sales like before,

00:02:15.884 --> 00:02:19.729
but select two rather than one during the installation process.

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.844
So, that's the basics of how this application is working behind the scenes.

00:02:23.844 --> 00:02:26.330
Like I mentioned, it's quicker to get started this way,

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.335
but can be a little trickier to get used to where everything is.

00:02:29.335 --> 00:02:32.810
If you're familiar with folder structures from other web applications,

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.140
this hopefully isn't too much different than what you've experienced already.

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:38.839
If you have any questions about getting started,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.860
sales JS provides many tutorials and resources to help you along the way.
