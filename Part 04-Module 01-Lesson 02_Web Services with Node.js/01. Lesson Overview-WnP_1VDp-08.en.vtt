00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.734
Welcome to the lesson, Web Services with Node.js.

00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:05.849
This lesson is meant to help get you up and

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:08.724
running with a few popular Node.js Frameworks.

00:00:08.724 --> 00:00:11.219
In the last lesson, we looked more closely at

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.710
web applications and discussed the difference between back and front end development.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.400
We went over Node.js,

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:19.934
which helps you serve both back and front end data.

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:24.494
Knowing this helps you understand how to construct a solution for your application needs.

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:27.900
In this lesson, we'll dive deeper into how you can more easily

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.674
build out applications using what's known as a RESTful framework.

00:00:31.675 --> 00:00:34.579
RESTful frameworks give you access to guidelines and

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.804
tools that help you develop applications more efficiently.

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:40.780
Node.js has many frameworks, and in this lesson,

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.365
we'll cover three of them, Express, Sails and Hapi.

00:00:44.365 --> 00:00:47.060
We'll cover when each framework could be the right tool for

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.105
the job and when you might be better off with something else.

00:00:50.104 --> 00:00:51.829
You'll also get up and running with

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.295
the small Hello World application using each of these frameworks.

00:00:55.295 --> 00:00:58.670
Coming up next, we'll look a little closer at what a framework is,

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.015
then get started with our own application.

00:01:01.015 --> 00:01:02.945
So, welcome again to the lesson.

00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:06.000
I'm excited to get started with Node.js Frameworks.
