00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500
In general, Wallets have feature limitations that can make them difficult to manage.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.060
With the debug console,

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:11.544
you can gain access to additional features that are hidden from the user interface.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:14.460
In this video, we'll cover three commands you can use

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.480
to explore wild information from the debug console.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.914
We'll cover getwalletinfo, listwallets, and walletspassphrasechange.

00:00:22.914 --> 00:00:27.554
These commands are extremely important when configuring Blockchain services.

00:00:27.554 --> 00:00:30.370
First, we'll look at getwalletinfo.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.035
getwalletinfo returns various information about the state of a wallet.

00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:39.894
This is a helpful way to access wallet balances and other metadata.

00:00:39.895 --> 00:00:41.530
Using the help function,

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.765
you can see that this will return details about the wallet name,

00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:47.609
version, balance, and much more.

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:51.689
Try running this command for yourself by typing getwalletinfo.

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:55.699
As you can see, the name of my wallet is wallet.dat.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.950
This is the standard wallet name and yours is probably similar.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.730
It also shows that I've made

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.769
zero transactions and sadly that I have no money in my wallet.

00:01:05.769 --> 00:01:09.204
If you've been playing around with your wallet and doing transactions,

00:01:09.204 --> 00:01:12.260
it might show something else here, and that's fine too.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.560
Next, we'll check out the listwallets command.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.820
This command returns a list of currently loaded wallets,

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:21.774
meaning anywhere that you have available under your account.

00:01:21.775 --> 00:01:23.180
Using the help function,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.925
we can see that this is a pretty straightforward command.

00:01:25.924 --> 00:01:30.209
It tells us that we'll get back a wallet name and provides a few examples.

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:32.810
Let's try this by typing listwallets.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.689
What I get back is the same wallet.dat that came up using the previous command.

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.844
This isn't too exciting yet,

00:01:40.844 --> 00:01:44.924
but it becomes more useful in cases where you start managing multiple wallets.

00:01:44.924 --> 00:01:49.579
This will be common as you start building applications to test transactions between them.

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.959
Or if you have other reasons to manage multiple wallets for yourself.

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:59.459
You can also check to see that this is correct by navigating to your main bitcoin folder.

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:05.214
What you see here is the wallet.dat that's being read from the debug console.

00:02:05.215 --> 00:02:08.884
Finally, let's look at walletpassphrasechange.

00:02:08.884 --> 00:02:11.349
The purpose of this command is to change the wallet

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.060
passphrase from its current passphrase to a new one.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.590
You might remember this passphrase as

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.235
the 12 word phrase you used when you originally created your wallet.

00:02:21.235 --> 00:02:23.140
This helps you do things like recover

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:26.014
your wallet in the case that you forgot your password.

00:02:26.014 --> 00:02:29.709
Using the help menu, you'll see that this command expects you to provide

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.115
both the old passphrase and the new passphrase along with the command.

00:02:34.115 --> 00:02:37.480
I'm not interested in updating my passphrase right now so,

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:39.069
I'll leave this command alone.

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.560
I only wanted to mention it to show you that things like this are possible.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.849
To quickly recap, we just walked through some of the details of

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.894
three helpful commands you can use related to wallets.

00:02:48.895 --> 00:02:54.240
These commands were getwalletinfo, listwallets, and walletpassphrasechange.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.950
These will help you manage wallets you create when building

00:02:56.949 --> 00:03:00.869
applications or when checking out your own personal wallets.
