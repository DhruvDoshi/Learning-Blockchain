00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.714
All right. You made it to the end of the lesson.

00:00:02.714 --> 00:00:06.525
In this lesson, we discussed the Bitcoin Core Debug Console.

00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:11.504
We also walked through many useful commands for each of the core block chain components.

00:00:11.503 --> 00:00:13.980
Hopefully, you're comfortable enough to explore these

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.545
further and look through a few more of these on your own.

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:20.790
Another goal we mentioned was that you take some time to understand how the concepts we

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.320
described earlier are being represented by the data shown with these commands.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.019
If you're able to tie the concepts to the data,

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.745
you'll be in a great spot as we move on to more complicated topics.

00:00:31.745 --> 00:00:35.329
This lesson also helped prepare you to complete the next project.

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.500
We will use this data to build your own private blockchain.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.659
In the next lesson, we'll continue to build on these skills.

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:43.929
For more details on the upcoming lesson,

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:46.335
feel free to read through the text below the video.

00:00:46.335 --> 00:00:49.520
When you're ready we'll see you in the next lesson.
