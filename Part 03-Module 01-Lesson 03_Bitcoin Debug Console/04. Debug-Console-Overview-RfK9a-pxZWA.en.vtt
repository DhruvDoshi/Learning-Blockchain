00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.785
It's possible to explore Bitcoin data not only from websites and block explorers,

00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:07.019
but directly from a command line.

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:09.705
Understanding how to do this is a huge step

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:12.675
towards programming your own blockchain applications.

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:15.540
In this video, we'll familiarize you with one way to

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.619
do this using the Bitcoin Core Debug console.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.390
We'll introduce some of its core features and get you started with a few of its commands.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.550
The debug console assist with debugging efforts and

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.080
provides a window to the Bitcoin Core RPC console.

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.989
The RPC console is essential to back-end services with Bitcoin blockchain.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.460
It also allows you to investigate the blockchain as new blocks are introduced.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.054
Now let's go ahead and start using it.

00:00:42.054 --> 00:00:43.689
To access the console,

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:46.399
first go to your Bitcoin core client.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.089
From there, navigate to help in the top menu bar,

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.695
then select debug window.

00:00:52.695 --> 00:00:57.155
Here you should see a screen similar to ours welcoming you to the console.

00:00:57.155 --> 00:01:01.674
It also includes a warning message about being cautious when running commands.

00:01:01.674 --> 00:01:04.269
We recommend that while testing these features,

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.829
you continue to use wallets that are not connected to any actual Bitcoin value.

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:10.420
Please be careful.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.730
If you're connected to a wallet that is not storing information,

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.335
there should be no problems with experimenting using the console.

00:01:17.334 --> 00:01:19.254
Down at the bottom of the screen,

00:01:19.254 --> 00:01:21.280
you'll see a place to input commands.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.695
This is how you interact with the console.

00:01:23.694 --> 00:01:26.494
A great way to start is with the help command.

00:01:26.495 --> 00:01:28.030
Select the command prompt,

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.234
type "Help" and click "Enter."

00:01:30.234 --> 00:01:32.950
What you see now is all of the available commands,

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.984
you can use to navigate the blockchain with this tool.

00:01:35.984 --> 00:01:37.790
There's a lot of commands here,

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.475
but to help you out, they split them up into a few main categories.

00:01:41.474 --> 00:01:45.384
These categories are Blockchain, Control, Generating,

00:01:45.385 --> 00:01:49.984
Mining, Network, Raw transactions, Util and Wallet.

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:54.129
Note that whenever you see something following the command and the help menu,

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:56.049
it means that the console is expecting

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.539
some extra input from you to return the information you request.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.790
Each of these commands are pretty clearly laid out to allow

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.795
you to easily experiment based on what you're interested in.

00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:10.530
You can get the details on any of these commands by typing Help,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.515
followed by the name of the command.

00:02:12.514 --> 00:02:15.339
We'll use the Help function pretty extensively as we

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.474
review these commands in more detail throughout the lesson.

00:02:18.474 --> 00:02:20.710
Try a few of them for yourself to get

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.474
more information about any of the commands on the list.

00:02:23.474 --> 00:02:26.859
So there's some basics to get you started with the debug console.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.110
This is a really interesting tool that allows you to

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.645
explore a ton of data on the blockchain.

00:02:31.645 --> 00:02:34.525
Remember, the Help command is your best friend here.

00:02:34.525 --> 00:02:38.920
You can always use this to explore more information about each of these commands,

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:41.984
but we're definitely not done walking through the different commands available.

00:02:41.985 --> 00:02:44.400
We'll be going through more of these throughout the lesson.
