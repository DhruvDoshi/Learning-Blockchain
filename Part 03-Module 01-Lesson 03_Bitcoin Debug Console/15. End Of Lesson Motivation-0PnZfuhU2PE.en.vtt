00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.995
Alright. So we just wrapped up learning

00:00:01.995 --> 00:00:04.800
a ton of new commands that you can use in the debug console,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.325
and honestly it can really be a lot.

00:00:06.325 --> 00:00:08.265
There's dozens of commands probably.

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:10.290
I was wondering, when you use it,

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.595
is there any command in particular that you found particularly helpful?

00:00:13.595 --> 00:00:16.680
That's great. I mean, you just got done saying it right, helpful.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.140
Anytime that I need to discover new functionality on any blockchain platform,

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.605
the very first go to command for me is help,

00:00:23.605 --> 00:00:25.835
and you can see that right there in the debug console.

00:00:25.835 --> 00:00:27.540
Just type in help, and it'll list

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.450
all the available functionality in regards to console

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.400
you can make for the Bitcoin Core Platform.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.620
It's the same similar thing you can do with other platforms,

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.970
like Etherium, hyperledger, stellar, it just goes on.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.800
So help is by far my favorite command to use.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.650
Yeah. No, I definitely used it a time.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.330
There's a couple of other commands I like too.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.210
I find it interesting when certain commands string together.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.280
So it's like, to get block,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.950
you first have to get block hash and then you can sort of trace

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.490
back to an original core idea.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.840
I find those helpful, but whenever I get lost in that,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.725
I go straight back to help too.

00:01:03.725 --> 00:01:06.295
So yeah, definitely very great command for me.

00:01:06.295 --> 00:01:10.400
It reminds me of a time where we were experimenting with some of the commands,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.210
you remember I was going along route like,

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.900
I would go ahead and get

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.420
a raw transaction right and I would get the information and then I would

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.610
perform another command to go ahead and translate that to human readable tags like,

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.635
"Hold on, Brandy, you wouldn't believe what I just discovered",

00:01:25.635 --> 00:01:29.390
and you showed me how to go ahead and do that all in one command. That was super cool.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.485
I just figured it out by using help.

00:01:31.485 --> 00:01:35.465
Perfect. So there we go, favorite command, Help.

00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:37.075
Thanks Brandy.

00:01:37.075 --> 00:01:38.750
You're welcome.
