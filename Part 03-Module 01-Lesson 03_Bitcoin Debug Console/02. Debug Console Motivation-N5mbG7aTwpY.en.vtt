00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.055
Hey, everybody.

00:00:01.055 --> 00:00:03.090
I'm back with Brandy and before we get started

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.355
in this next lesson, I had a couple questions.

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:09.540
We are choosing to focus a lot on the Bitcoin debug console throughout the lesson,

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.565
and I was wondering what made you decide that

00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:13.895
this was important to learn and how does it help the students?

00:00:13.895 --> 00:00:17.520
Yes, excellent. So, the debug console is really another tool for

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.325
us in our toolbox for discovering new services within blockchain.

00:00:21.325 --> 00:00:25.145
Now of course, every platform has their own toolset, right?

00:00:25.145 --> 00:00:27.720
Right now, we're discovering the world of

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.060
Bitcoin Core and how we can work with the blockchain for Bitcoin course platform.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.160
And the debug console allows us to

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.340
explore and that's where I really love about the debug console.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.160
All right, cool. And another question before we get started that I had,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.990
is we're focusing a lot so far in this program on Bitcoin specifically,

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.100
but that's not the only blockchain out there.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.960
There's tons of other options and we actually

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.110
playing on exploring some of them later in the program.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.385
Particularly, Ethereum, and I was wondering,

00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:55.785
how does some of the stuff we're going to learn about the debug console

00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:58.785
now translate into what we'll be doing with Ethereum later?

00:00:58.785 --> 00:01:00.540
Yeah, that's a fantastic question,

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.060
and this is something I'm actually excited about.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.480
You know, you don't really appreciate the toolset until you see the power of

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.820
the tool working and that's what we're doing at the debug console and right now,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.740
we're focusing on Bitcoin cause it's literally

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.040
the first generation of blockchain services.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.250
Bitcoin created blockchain, right?

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.160
I mean, obviously, it's an underpinning of

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.920
the technology and now we're seeing the power of

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.180
it as we're navigating board to

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.700
second generation blockchain services and that's the Ethereum platform,

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.830
second generation with smart contract.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.700
So, what's interesting is we're going to see a lot of these commands that

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.950
we're utilizing now within the debug console also

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.270
participate with the Ethereum platform and it's

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.350
super nice because we get to utilize the same concepts with other platforms.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.030
So, we have Ethereum,

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.470
but there's so many more out there that we can experiment with.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.100
So, it's really nice to know that there's always something to

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.250
experiment with to understand what functionality really

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.430
exists with that platform and it always starts with one way to

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.075
discover functionality and the debug console is a fantastic way to do it.

00:02:00.075 --> 00:02:02.880
Great, thanks. Yeah, it's been really exciting seeing all the connections

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.755
between the different platforms and how related they actually all are.

00:02:05.755 --> 00:02:07.385
So throughout the rest of the lesson out,

00:02:07.385 --> 00:02:09.120
we're going to be talking about the debug console

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.410
and we hope you're excited to get started.
