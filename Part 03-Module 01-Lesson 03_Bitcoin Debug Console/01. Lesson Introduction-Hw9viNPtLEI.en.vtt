00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.044
Welcome to this lesson on the Bitcoin Core Debug Console.

00:00:04.044 --> 00:00:06.629
Previously, he worked on the testnet and create

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.500
a transactions using the user interface of your Bitcoin core wallet.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.929
While this interface is a great start,

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.859
the real power comes from being able to access this information programmatically.

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.994
You can do that using what's known as the Bitcoin Core Debug Console.

00:00:20.995 --> 00:00:23.190
Throughout the lesson, we'll discuss many of

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.650
the commands available to you in the debug console.

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:27.899
Our goal is to help you get set up to

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.924
confidently explore blockchain data using this tool.

00:00:30.925 --> 00:00:35.359
We'll do this by covering commands for each component in the block chain framework.

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:38.299
This lesson builds on everything you've learned so far.

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:40.739
It's where this program really starts to turn from

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.510
conceptual ideas to the lower level nuts and bolts you'll need to build an application.

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:48.719
Don't worry, we're not going off the deep end here and we've

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.780
really tried to make this lesson in a way that's relatable,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.015
approachable and allows you to be prepared for more advanced topics later on.

00:00:56.015 --> 00:01:00.268
Also, there's one really important thing we want you to get from this lesson,

00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:02.439
that will take a little effort on your part.

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:05.909
In this lesson, you'll have a huge opportunity to type the data you're

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.030
seeing to the conceptual ideas we've talked about earlier in the program.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.674
For example, when looking at block data,

00:01:12.674 --> 00:01:16.140
think about how this relates to what you understand a block to be.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.420
What images in your head already?

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.340
How does this data relate to that image?

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.790
Putting in the extra effort here is going to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.310
allow you to visualize how all this connects.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.060
This will become invaluable as we start building more complicated programs later on.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.674
We put a few more details below the video.

00:01:33.674 --> 00:01:36.855
If you'd like, take some time to read through and when you're ready

00:01:36.855 --> 00:01:40.680
we'll see you in this lesson on the Bitcoin Core Debug Console.
