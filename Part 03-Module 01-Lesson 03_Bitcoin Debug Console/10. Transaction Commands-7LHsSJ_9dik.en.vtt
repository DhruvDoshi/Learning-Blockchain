00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.399
While it's generally don't give access to

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.634
transaction information beyond the ones you made personally,

00:00:05.634 --> 00:00:07.664
but using the debug console,

00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:11.894
you can explore details of transactions from across the entire network.

00:00:11.894 --> 00:00:15.269
In this video, we'll cover three helpful commands related to

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.564
transactions that you can perform in the Bitcoin Core debug console.

00:00:19.565 --> 00:00:21.210
The commands we'll cover are

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.510
getchain transactions stats, getrawtransaction, and listtransaction.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.740
Transactions are at the core of everything that happens on the blockchain,

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.009
and getting access to this information will be invaluable as you

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:37.920
begin putting this type of functionality into your blockchain applications.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.664
To start, let's look at getchain transaction stats.

00:00:41.664 --> 00:00:46.004
Getchain transactions stat or getchaintxstats

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:51.300
returns compute statistics about the total number and rate of transactions in the chain.

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:53.750
This is a great way to get an overview of

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.530
all transactions that are happening on the blockchain.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.365
Using the help function,

00:00:58.365 --> 00:01:01.300
you'll see that this returns information like the time,

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:05.579
transaction count, block count and other statistics about transactions.

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:11.480
Now, try running this command in your console by typing getchaintxstats.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.090
We can see that the timestamp of the final block is here,

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.670
there are this many transactions and there's

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.954
about this many transactions made per second.

00:01:20.954 --> 00:01:24.280
Next, let's look at getrawtransaction.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.180
Getrawtransaction allows you to look at the details of any raw transaction data.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.740
A raw transaction is a transaction that is formatted to be readable by computers.

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:38.500
It follows the rules of the Bitcoin protocol to process

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.200
the human readable transaction and turn it into

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.304
a single value that can be interpreted by a computer.

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:47.230
Having access to raw transaction data is

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.579
the first step towards being able to create or manipulate these transactions.

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.265
Let's look at the details of this command using the help function.

00:01:55.265 --> 00:01:57.614
As you can see, to run this command,

00:01:57.614 --> 00:02:01.170
you'll need to provide a transaction ID. Let's try that.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.189
A quick note on this command is that it

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.149
defaults to accepting transactions and the mem pool.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.650
So, to get our mem pool transaction,

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.235
we can type in getrawmempool.

00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:12.970
From this list of hashes,

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.849
pick one as the input for getrawtransaction.

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.150
Now, type getrawtransaction, paste in

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.689
the transaction id and follow this with the word true.

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:27.099
Using true, allows you to see more information about the transaction.

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.250
When you're done, run this command and see what you get.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.069
What you'll see first is just a huge string of

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.674
numbers containing information like the hash,

00:02:35.675 --> 00:02:38.645
version, size, and other useful details.

00:02:38.645 --> 00:02:41.344
This is a lot of information, so if you'd like,

00:02:41.344 --> 00:02:44.645
pause the video and take a look before we move on.

00:02:44.645 --> 00:02:46.325
For our last command,

00:02:46.324 --> 00:02:48.399
let's look at listtransactions.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.849
Like you might expect,

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.710
this gives us a list of transactions for a given account.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.120
This is helpful if you ever want to explore

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.730
transactions that have been made by a given user,

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:01.454
or if you want to present this data to a user with your application.

00:03:01.455 --> 00:03:03.045
Using the help function,

00:03:03.044 --> 00:03:05.854
you can see this returns the account, address,

00:03:05.854 --> 00:03:11.139
category, amount or other details about a given set of transaction information.

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.318
You can provide this command arguments like the account,

00:03:14.318 --> 00:03:16.030
total count of transactions,

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.425
and any transactions you'd like to skip.

00:03:18.425 --> 00:03:19.855
To run this command,

00:03:19.854 --> 00:03:23.109
type listtransactions into the console and what you'll get

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.045
back is a list of all the transactions for the account you specify.

00:03:27.044 --> 00:03:29.099
The default is your own account,

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.460
and I don't have any transactions on this account,

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.115
so it's just showing up as an empty array.

00:03:34.115 --> 00:03:38.020
Yours may also be blank but once you start working with transactions,

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.760
this empty array should start to fill up.

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:43.014
To quickly recap, we discussed

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:46.689
three helpful commands you can use to explore transaction information.

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:53.134
These commands were getchaintransactionstats, getrawtransaction and listtransactions.

00:03:53.134 --> 00:03:56.169
These commands will be very valuable as you start working with

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.799
transactions while building your blockchain applications.
