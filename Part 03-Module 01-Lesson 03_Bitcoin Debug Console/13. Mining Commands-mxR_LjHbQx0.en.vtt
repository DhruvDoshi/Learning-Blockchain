00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
The Bitcoin Blockchain currently uses miners and proof-of-work to achieve consensus.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.839
Using the debug console,

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.015
we can check out information about miners on the network.

00:00:10.015 --> 00:00:13.110
In this video, we'll cover two commands you can use

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.019
to explore mining info using your debug console.

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:20.375
We'll cover getmininginfo and prioritisetransaction.

00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:24.829
These commands are a great way to get an overview of the state of each block,

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.320
it provides ways to use block data that might

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.460
help you with creating and testing applications later on.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.500
First, let's look at getmininginfo.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.174
getmininginfo returns an overview of mining related information,

00:00:38.174 --> 00:00:40.969
this helps you understand some pretty interesting things

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.164
like which block is currently being worked on by a minor.

00:00:44.164 --> 00:00:45.769
Using the help command,

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.135
you can see that it will return the current block,

00:00:48.134 --> 00:00:49.655
the weight of the last block,

00:00:49.655 --> 00:00:52.359
transaction information and more.

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.125
I'll run this now by typing getmininginfo.

00:00:56.125 --> 00:01:00.994
Here it shows we're currently on this block along with some other information.

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:04.754
If you're still wondering why the blockchain is so large to download,

00:01:04.754 --> 00:01:06.795
here's a good example of why.

00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:08.745
Even being on the test net,

00:01:08.745 --> 00:01:11.650
we're still sync to over 1,000,000 blocks,

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.234
with each block being around two megabytes,

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:17.019
this can easily take up a lot of space.

00:01:17.019 --> 00:01:21.364
Another command I wanted to show you was prioritisetransaction.

00:01:21.364 --> 00:01:26.685
This command accepts a transaction into mined blocks at a higher or lower priority.

00:01:26.685 --> 00:01:29.385
This means that you can control the likelihood and

00:01:29.385 --> 00:01:32.500
order that transactions will be accepted into blocks.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.200
Having this type of control can be very helpful

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.174
later on when building and testing your applications.

00:01:38.174 --> 00:01:39.750
Using the help function,

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.034
you can see that it needs three inputs to run,

00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:45.914
the transaction id, a dummy value and a fee_delta.

00:01:45.915 --> 00:01:49.090
This is a little more complicated than other commands.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.159
This may come up again in testing,

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.170
but we can avoid running it for now.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.185
I just wanted to mention this command to show you that this type of thing is possible.

00:01:57.185 --> 00:02:00.040
One thing you might notice is that prioritise is

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.650
spelled with an 'S' where normally I'd spell it with a Z,

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.190
that's common in the UK and it tells us

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.954
that whoever came up with this was likely from there.

00:02:08.955 --> 00:02:11.930
Given that Satoshi Nakamoto is still unknown,

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.819
maybe this is a clue that they are from the UK? You never know.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.555
We might just find them someday using clues like this,

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:21.585
but anyway, there's some of the commands related to mining.

00:02:21.585 --> 00:02:26.379
To recap, we just went over getmininginfo and prioritisetransaction.

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.894
These types of commands will be very useful as we begin creating our own applications.

00:02:30.895 --> 00:02:32.710
Feel free to explore these further,

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.270
before moving on to other commands.
