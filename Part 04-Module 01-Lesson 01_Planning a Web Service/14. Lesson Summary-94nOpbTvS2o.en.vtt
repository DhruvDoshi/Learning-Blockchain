00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.559
This lesson was all about planning and developing the mental framework for how

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:08.714
to go about converting a private Blockchain into a valuable web services.

00:00:08.714 --> 00:00:11.669
In this lesson, we discuss how to analyze

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:15.120
blockchain use cases to determine if it requires a web service.

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:17.914
Then we decide on a web service language.

00:00:17.914 --> 00:00:22.500
Explained the Node.js framework and components for the blockchain.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.490
Lastly, decide an appropriate mock data set.

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.820
Throughout this lesson, we laid the foundation for how

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.793
to modify our private blockchain with Node.js,

00:00:32.793 --> 00:00:36.114
RESTful APIs, and other third-party libraries to

00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:40.704
interact with your private Blockchain to submit and audit Blockchain data.

00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:43.835
Coming up, we'll begin the process to configure

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:47.640
web API services with GET and POST endpoints.
