00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.975
This section is about planning and developing your mental tools.

00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:06.810
Let's talk about how we made the decisions we did to

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:10.169
configure an API web service with GET/POST endpoints.

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:11.865
For this course and project,

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:16.070
we decided to build and deploy a local web service with Node.js.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.690
I want to discuss the reasons behind why we chose to use Node.js and

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.855
elaborate on its components there will be

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:25.030
integral to the development process as we move forward.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.920
In this section, we will introduce Node.js then

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.190
set it up and then quickly overview nodes components.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.334
Then, we'll cover the client and server features and, lastly,

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:38.000
discuss the appropriate mock data

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.740
set remember a large part of this lesson is building the skills to know

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.710
how to analyze your blockchain use case and determine if it

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.945
requires a web service or not and if so, how to plan for it.

00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:54.359
With that in mind, let's start with a quick introduction of Node.js.
