00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
What's a web service in the context of the blockchain world?

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.450
So, a traditional web service it's just,

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.370
you've got a server and you may have some front in front

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:12.029
of it or some API gateway and then clients will query

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.629
that server and get back data right as it will render in the browser

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.365
or they will consume it at the command line or via program and do something with it.

00:00:20.364 --> 00:00:24.299
The difference in the blockchain era is a web service's back-end is no longer

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.589
just a Postgres or MySQL database often in the cloud,

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.039
but it can also include

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:35.804
a decentralized blockchain backend or multiple de-centralized backends.

00:00:35.804 --> 00:00:39.240
Notice that, web service in the era blockchain doesn't have

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.480
to only have a blockchain based backend but just another backend,

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:44.224
it's a sheared backend that

00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:49.865
multiple different actors can read from and if they spend digital currency can write too.

00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:54.829
So, that's what a web service is in the age of blockchain it's got usually both the

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.469
original Postgres based backend and it

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.539
can tap into one or more blockchain based de-centralized backends.

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.570
So, do companies in systems need to rewire

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.394
the entire stack to take adventure blockchain technology?

00:01:05.394 --> 00:01:07.114
In some cases yes,

00:01:07.114 --> 00:01:12.319
because what a blockchain represents is a completely new payment rail and whether

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:13.369
the complete new payment rail is

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.950
completely different often regulatory environment and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.840
a completely different degree of risk tolerance for the business.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.549
In my view, relatively few companies that

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.015
are Finance 1.0 or Wall Street 1.0 will be able to make the transition successfully.

00:01:28.015 --> 00:01:29.905
If you look at what the internet did,

00:01:29.905 --> 00:01:34.439
it has basically disrupted traditional books, newspapers, movies, music,

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.489
and relatively few of the incumbents are still around

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:40.670
today in the same form like Blockbuster was disrupted by

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.760
Netflix and Kodak was disrupted by Instagram and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.260
the digital players have

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.990
different economics and cost structure and they came up in a different way.

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:51.319
I think blockchain has that same revolutionary potential.

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.569
Now with that said, some of the incumbents were

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:56.059
smart and they did at least play it a good defense.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.299
The New York Times for example has a very good website,

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.500
many of the music and movie companies eventually did get into streaming simply

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.450
some defense and I do expect some of

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.069
the existing financial incumbents to play defense right?

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.949
So, the banks and when they're smart

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.084
enough that they are working on blockchain based things.

00:02:12.085 --> 00:02:13.710
But it's not core to them,

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.680
they weren't built on the blockchain and they've got 50, 70,

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.439
100 years of legacy that they have to deal

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.740
with the theme of the New York Times still has log

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.000
in contracts because it's still doing paper news.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.710
Something that's built on a blockchain has

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.110
a fundamental agility and advantage sure

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.330
that's something that's a legacy business doesn't have,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.990
that's why it's challenging but not impossible for companies to

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:42.409
rip and replace or augment their existing payment systems with blockchain.
