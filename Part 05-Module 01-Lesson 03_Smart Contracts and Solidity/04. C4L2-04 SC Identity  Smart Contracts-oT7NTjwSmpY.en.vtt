00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.419
In this video, we'll talk about what identity means on the Ethereum blockchain.

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:07.049
Identity can be defined in many ways.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.960
It's an extremely broad topic that might involve tying

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.245
your real-world identity to an Ethereum public address.

00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:15.239
However, for our purposes,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.344
we'll just say that you're blushing identity is your theory and public address.

00:00:19.344 --> 00:00:23.254
This means that when a smart contract allocates resources to user,

00:00:23.254 --> 00:00:25.919
just given that user tokens or other assets,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.280
they're doing so by using that user's public Ethereum address,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.410
which is also called the wallet.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.170
Let's explore the Ethereum blockchain and see if we can deduce

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.695
some pieces of information from some of the users on the Ethereum blockchain.

00:00:41.695 --> 00:00:44.554
Let's go back to the CryptoPunks website

00:00:44.554 --> 00:00:47.909
and look at one of the owners for one of the Punks.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.680
Here we can see that this particular Ethereum public wallet

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.070
is the owner for this CryptoPunk.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.420
We can then use an Ethereum blockchain explorer such that

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.500
Etherscan to see more information about this user.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.310
Here we can see their entire transaction history and see what other assets that

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.344
wallet has as well as what smart contracts this wallet interacted with.

00:01:21.344 --> 00:01:25.245
Etherscan is really good at showing you transaction histories,

00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:29.344
but not so great at viewing what other crypto collectibles as wallet has.

00:01:29.344 --> 00:01:32.269
Other websites like Rare Bits specialize in

00:01:32.269 --> 00:01:35.089
figuring out what crypto collectibles a wallet has,

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.630
and so here we can see that this wallet also has some other crypto assets.

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:42.109
To summarize, even though we do not know

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:45.084
the real identity of the user for this random wallet,

00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:48.904
we can say that this user's blockchain identity is their wallet.

00:01:48.905 --> 00:01:54.320
In short, Ethereum public address allows you to have an identity on the Ethereum network.

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.389
It allows for smart contracts and

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.780
other users to allocate resources or assets to your wallet.
