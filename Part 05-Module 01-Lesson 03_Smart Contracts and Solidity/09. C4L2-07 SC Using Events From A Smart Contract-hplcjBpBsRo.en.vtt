00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.284
Some of you might be wondering,

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:08.594
how do I know when a function called to a smart contract has gone through?

00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:10.845
That is an excellent question.

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:14.339
One way to do that will be to emit a log within

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.759
this smart contract or when a certain action has occurred.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.890
Let's go back to remix and look at the Smart Contracts.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.975
Let's figure out a way if we can be notified somehow when this function is called.

00:00:33.975 --> 00:00:37.500
One way we can do that is by emitting events,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.140
which are basically logs in survey.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.469
Let's define our event,

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.740
the event is going to be called star point as

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.520
window log the address of the new owner from start.

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.719
When someone claims to start here will emit this event.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.385
All right. Let's see if this compiles.

00:01:11.385 --> 00:01:16.109
It does and let's go ahead and deploy it again.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.489
So now, we deployed a new version of the Smart Contract with

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:27.619
a new address and because we now have a new event,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.395
we use a different API as well.

00:01:30.394 --> 00:01:33.879
We go back to the compile tab and click on details,

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:37.140
you'll see that the API has one more field,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.364
which is an event for star planes.

00:01:40.364 --> 00:01:43.559
Go ahead and copy that API.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.930
If you go back to your code,

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.290
you're going to replace the old API with the new one.

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:05.579
Similarly, because we had to create a new contract,

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.588
since launching this needable,

00:02:07.588 --> 00:02:11.664
it now has a new contract with a new contract address.

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:15.349
Go ahead and click on the coffee value to clipboard button

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.444
again in order to get the new value for the Smart Contract address.

00:02:19.444 --> 00:02:23.650
Go ahead and replace it with the old one that we have here.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:32.530
Great. So now, we have access to star claimed event.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.099
Let's go ahead and use it here.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.465
Before reloading the page like this,

00:02:42.465 --> 00:02:50.730
let's first check if the event was fired and the way we would do that,

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:55.269
we would create star planed event,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.539
which equals starNotary.starClaimed,

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.270
and we're going to watch on it,

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.570
which is a function that once again gives us an error and the results.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.900
It was properly fired without an error,

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.150
that's when we can reload the page,

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:37.674
otherwise we're going to go ahead and make a console statements,

00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:40.810
then I'll go see get debug further.

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:57.344
That's it. Now, we can go back and have a slightly better version.

00:03:57.344 --> 00:04:01.685
To see how it take a little bit more time because I wanted to make

00:04:01.685 --> 00:04:06.120
sure that we had an updated value when you start owning.
