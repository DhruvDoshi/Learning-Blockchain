Congratulations on making it through the lesson.

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:06.195
In this lesson, we went over the basics of solidity.

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:10.345
We wrote a simple Smart Contract that we deployed in our locally Ethereum test network.

00:00:10.345 --> 00:00:13.075
We also made a simple web page to interact with it.

00:00:13.074 --> 00:00:14.879
In the next lesson, we'll dive into

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.964
the more complex aspects of writing in decentralized app.

00:00:17.964 --> 00:00:21.519
We'll learn about the Ethereum improvement proposals and standards,

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:23.640
and use the numerous development tools of

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.800
the Ethereum development ecosystem has to offer. Let's get to it.
