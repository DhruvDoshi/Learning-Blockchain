00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.334
Congratulations! That was a lot,

00:00:02.334 --> 00:00:03.839
and you all went through it.

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:07.605
To recap, we went over how to use MetaMask in our webpage.

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:10.080
We tested our smart contract as we wrote it,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.949
to make sure it behaves exactly like we expect to.

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:15.660
Afterwards, we explored some of the standards that

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.685
the Ethereum community established on how to write certain smart contracts,

00:00:19.684 --> 00:00:22.734
and implemented the ERC-721 standard.

00:00:22.734 --> 00:00:26.640
I then showed you how to use Zeppelin to leverage the already implemented set of

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.789
libraries and standards to make smart contract development super fast.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.225
Lastly, we went over using Truffle for

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:36.795
easier web development and Infura for easy deployment.

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:38.640
You're now fully equipped with some of

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.230
the best tool in the industry has to offer at this time.

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:44.959
You'll have a blast exploring all these tools to build your uncensored,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.799
de-centralized, unstoppable app. Have fun.
