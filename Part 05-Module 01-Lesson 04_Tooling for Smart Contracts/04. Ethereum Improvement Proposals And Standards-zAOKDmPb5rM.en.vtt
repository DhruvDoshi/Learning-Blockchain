00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.339
In this section, we'll go over how the Ethereum community proposes improvements,

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.039
and how that affects the smart contract development best practices.

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:11.449
The list of Ethereum improvement proposals,

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:15.954
or EIPs, can be found on Ethereum's GitHub repository.

00:00:15.955 --> 00:00:18.920
Anyone can propose a new EIP.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.655
That EIP then goes through a review process by anyone in the Ethereum community.

00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:26.190
I encourage you to look through some of the open EIPs,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.230
and see if you can provide valuable feedback to

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.489
the review process because you're all now part of the Ethereum community.

00:00:32.488 --> 00:00:36.390
Let's explore the more readable view for all EIPs.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.969
An EIP is one of these types.

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.339
We will focus on exploring ERCs,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.595
which are applicational standards and conventions.

00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:49.700
Here we'll see a list of all ERC/EIPs and their statuses.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.859
Let's look at some of the accepted ones.

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.379
One of the most important ERCs is the ERC-20.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.545
Ethereum is the largest, tougher, pretty tokens.

00:01:01.545 --> 00:01:04.129
Ethereum makes it really easy for anyone to create

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.674
their own token cryptocurrency with a simple smart contract.

00:01:07.674 --> 00:01:10.489
Unfortunately, before there was a standard of how to write

00:01:10.489 --> 00:01:13.129
these tokens smart contracts in order for a marketplace,

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:15.935
service, or an exchange to add these custom tokens,

00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:19.090
they would need to know the contract interface for each token.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.780
So, the Ethereum community decided to create a standard or an interface,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.885
that would dictate higher smart contract for token should be written.

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:27.640
This last marketplace, exchanges,

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.635
or services, to easily interact with it.

00:01:30.635 --> 00:01:33.969
In short, ERC-20 is an interface that

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:37.405
proposes how token smart contracts should be written.

00:01:37.405 --> 00:01:40.909
ERC-20 tokens are fungible, like money.

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.679
If I wanted to spend a dollar,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.790
it doesn't matter if I spent this dollar bill or that dollar bill,

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.410
as the value of all dollar bills is the same.

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.075
Non-fungible assets are distinguishable assets that are unique,

00:01:52.075 --> 00:01:54.640
like land, artwork, or collectibles.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.200
Just as we have a way to represent wealth with non-fungible assets in the real world,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.930
we have a way to do that with Ethereum as well.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.680
The standard to represent non-fungible tokens is called ERC-721,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.930
and it looks like this.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.694
The authors of this proposal wanted to create an interface

00:02:12.694 --> 00:02:15.799
that represented all possible distinguishable assets on Ethereum,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.030
like physical property, virtual collectibles,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.955
or even negative assets like debt.

00:02:19.955 --> 00:02:22.820
This means that in order for us to make a collection,

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.435
undistinguishable stars for a star notary that is a true non-fungible asset on Ethereum,

00:02:28.435 --> 00:02:30.620
we must follow this standard.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.155
Let's go ahead and implement the ERC-721 standard,

00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:37.039
so we can use it for our star notary service.
