00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.054
The first tool we'll go over is called MetaMask.

00:00:05.054 --> 00:00:08.669
MetaMask allows the users on your website to do action choosing

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:10.320
their own wallets without providing

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.230
their private keys for us to do actions on their behalf.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.655
It also gives users more transparency on what transactions are being made,

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:20.025
based on their interactions with the website.

00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:24.969
Let's go ahead and add MetaMask support to our Star notary service.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.695
MetaMask currently works as a Chrome plugin extension or as part of the Brave browser.

00:00:32.695 --> 00:00:36.409
We'll go ahead and use Chrome and install MetaMask as a plugin.

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:40.699
Since we'll keep using our Ganache look with Ethereum network, we'll set MetaMask.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.285
We received praises given to us when we first launched Ganache.

00:00:44.284 --> 00:00:46.879
Please note, to never use the seed phrase

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.895
generated by Ganache as your real main net wallet.

00:00:49.895 --> 00:00:53.330
This is because the seed phrase generation in Ganache is not random,

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.140
and other users might have access to your main wallet if created this way.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.649
Also note, that whenever we start our Ganache network,

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.240
we have to redeploy our smart contracts and update the new contract addressing our code.

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:39.854
I want us to use MetaMask.

00:01:39.855 --> 00:01:43.174
We'll only need a few modifications or JavaScript code.

00:01:43.174 --> 00:01:48.509
We'll need to learn MetaMask to inject its own Web3.js object.

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:58.274
We will also replace logic,

00:01:58.275 --> 00:02:00.090
setting in default account.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.740
Instead, we'll ask the Web3 object what accounts are available and take the top one,

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:09.379
as that's the one that we use to select MetaMask.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.409
If we want MetaMask to work properly is [inaudible] ,

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.349
will have to host your web page on a local server.

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.979
To do that, we'll simply use http-server.

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:46.539
Type npm install -g hp - server.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.570
The navigate to the working directory for the scores,

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.055
where the index HTML file is and type http-server.

00:02:59.055 --> 00:03:02.740
The serial web page now on localhost:8080.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.590
Let's see how our user interactions change.

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.859
As you can see, now the end-user has

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.130
a lot more flexibility and visibility into how their actions.

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:24.840
They're actually Ethereum blockchain.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.014
We can now change accounts to MetaMask and see you that that affects our results as well.

00:03:32.014 --> 00:03:35.284
Next, we'll explore another great tool called Truffle,

00:03:35.284 --> 00:03:39.599
that'll greatly help us with tests near a smart contract code.
