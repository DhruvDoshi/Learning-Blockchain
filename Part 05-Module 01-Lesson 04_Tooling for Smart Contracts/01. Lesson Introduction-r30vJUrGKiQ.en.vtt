00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
Hello everyone. Welcome to this lesson on,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.799
tooling for smart contracts.

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.500
In this lesson, we'll introduce various tools and

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.935
open-source platforms for faster smart contract development.

00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:13.940
These tools will help us achieve more complex functionality,

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:16.844
and increase security of our smart contracts.

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:19.799
We'll go over how to use a great tool called Metamask,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.140
for seamless interaction with your smart contracts from our web page.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.070
Next up, I'll show you how to write JavaScript tests for a smart contract.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.230
We'll then explore how the Ethereum community accepts new standards and improvements,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.320
and how to use the Zeppelin framework to increase security of your smart contracts.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.475
Afterwards, we'll focus on easier web development,

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:43.245
and introduce a simple way to deploy your smart contract to the official test networks,

00:00:43.244 --> 00:00:45.409
and finally, to Ethereum itself.

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:49.765
These are great tools that are used for production projects in the industry today.

00:00:49.765 --> 00:00:55.799
They'll help you greatly to make an awesome final project for this course. Let's dive in.
